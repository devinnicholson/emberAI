This repository contains experimental Model Context Protocol (or MCP) servers for interacting with Algolia APIs. We're sharing it for you to explore and experiment with.
Feel free to use it, fork it, or build on top of it ‚Äî but just know that it's not officially supported by Algolia and isn't covered under our SLA.

We might update it, break it, or remove it entirely at any time. If you customize or configure things here, there's a chance that work could be lost. Also, using MCP in production could affect your Algolia usage.

If you have feedback or ideas (even code!), we'd love to hear it. Just know that we might use it to help improve our products. This project is provided "as is" and "as available," with no guarantees or warranties. To be super clear: MCP isn't considered an "API Client" for SLA purposes.

## ‚ú® Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest release from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/algolia/mcp-node/releases)
2. **Authenticate** with your Algolia account
3. **Connect** to Claude Desktop
4. Start asking questions about your Algolia data!

> [!NOTE]
> For step-by-step instructions, follow the [installation guide](#-installation) and [configuration for Claude Desktop](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration).

## üöÄ Features

Algolia Node.js MCP enables natural language interactions with your Algolia data through Claude Desktop. This implementation allows you to:

- **Search and manipulate** indices with natural language
- **Analyze** search metrics and performance
- **Monitor** application status and incidents
- **Visualize** your data with AI-generated charts and graphs
- **Integrate** seamlessly with Claude Desktop through the Model Context Protocol

## üîÆ Usage Examples

Here are some example prompts to get you started:

### Account Management

```
"What is the email address associated with my Algolia account?"
```

### Applications

```
"List all my Algolia apps."
"List all the indices are in my 'e-commerce' application and format them into a table sorted by entries."
"Show me the configuration for my 'products' index."
```

### Search & Indexing

```
"Search my 'products' index for Nike shoes under $100."
"Add the top 10 programming books to my 'library' index using their ISBNs as objectIDs."
"How many records do I have in my 'customers' index?"
```

### Analytics & Insights

```
"What's the no-results rate for my 'products' index in the DE region? Generate a graph using React and Recharts."
"Show me the top 10 searches with no results in the DE region from last week."
```

### Monitoring & Performance

```
"Are there any ongoing incidents at Algolia?"
"What's the current latency for my 'e-commerce' index?"
"Show me a visualization of my daily account usage for the past month."
```

> [!TIP]
> Try providing your specific application and index in your initial prompt to avoid unnecessary back and forth.

## üì¶ Installation

### macOS

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/algolia/mcp-node/releases)
2. Extract the `.zip` file
3. From your terminal, remove quarantine flag to allow execution:
   ```sh
   xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine <path_to_executable>
   ```
   > **Note:** This step is necessary as the executable is not signed with an Apple Developer account. If you prefer, you can build from source instead.
4. Run the authentication command:
   ```sh
   <path_to_executable> authenticate
   ```
   This will open your browser to authenticate with the Algolia Dashboard.

### Windows & Linux

_Coming soon._

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

         "command": "<path_to_executable>"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Restart Claude Desktop

## üõ† Development

### Requirements

- Node.js 22 or higher
- npm

### Setup Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/algolia/mcp-node
   cd mcp-node
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure Claude Desktop for development:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "algolia-mcp": {
         "command": "<PATH_TO_BIN>/node",
         "args": [
           "--experimental-strip-types",
           "--no-warnings=ExperimentalWarning",
           "<PATH_TO_PROJECT>/src/app.ts"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

> **Note:** You'll need to restart Claude Desktop after making code changes.

### Build

```sh
npm run build -- --outfile dist/algolia-mcp
```

### Testing and Debugging

Use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) for testing and debugging:

1. Run the debug script:

   ```sh
   cd mcp-node
   npm run debug
   ```

2. Open http://127.0.0.1:6274/ in your browser
3. Click **Connect** to start the server
4. Send test requests through the inspector interface

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"App not responding" error:** Ensure you've removed the quarantine attribute on macOS
- **Authentication failures:** Try logging out and authenticating again
- **Claude can't access tools:** Verify your MCP configuration in Claude Desktop settings

### Logs and Diagnostics

Log files are stored in:

- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/algolia-mcp/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\algolia-mcp\logs\`
- Linux: `~/.config/algolia-mcp/logs/`
